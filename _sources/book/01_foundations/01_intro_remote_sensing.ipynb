    "## What is Remote Sensing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote sensing is an approach to obtain information about an object or area from a distance by detecting and measuring electromagnetic radiation, using ground-based, airborne, or spaceborne platforms.\n",

    "![Remote sensing concept](images/Fig1.png)\n",
    "#### Figure 1. Electromagnetic spectrum.\n",
    "The electromagnetic spectrum showing the range of wavelengths from gamma rays to radio waves. (resource: https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/Fundamentals_of_RS_Edited_SC.pdf)\n",

    "#### Figure 4. Incident angle on canopy leaves can be calculated from sun position (solar zenith angel and azimuth angle) and leaf inclination angles.\n",

    "### Canopy reflectance is is entangle with soil background\n",
    "Two models to simplify the canopy reflectance when there is a soil background.\n",

    "Both models can lead to the relationship between LIA and Top-of-Canopy reflectance (R)\n",
    "\n",
    "$LAI~=-\\frac 1 K log \\frac {R{\\infty}-R}{R_{\\infty}-R_{soil}}$\n",

    "which finaly leads to the formulation of PPI, using DVI instead of a single band reflectance."
